            Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work
            continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The
            first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
            Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of
            Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
            completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to
            be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
            billion (US$77.8 million).The building complex incorporates the
            design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It
            employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes
            and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble
            inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other
            buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the
            time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and
            artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad
            Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.

            The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in
            Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a
            symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of
            Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of
            a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both
            historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its
            popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has
            become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad.
            Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as
            Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main
            mosque, the Makkah Masjid.The Charminar is situated on the east bank
            of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the
            southwest the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an
            archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of
            monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The
            English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār
            and minar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are ornate
            minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[6]
